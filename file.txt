Heat causes matter in any state to expand, but it can grow more or less based on the state it's within. Also, when substances enlarge, the actual size of the atoms doesn't change. An example of this happening is sidewalks in the summer. During the summer, the heat from the sun will stretch the stone and then cause it to crack from it slowing down.
New Note
Conduction is the transfer of thermal energy through particles colliding/transfer of heat through touching. An illustration of conduction is touching a hot metal pan because the pan will transfer the heat from the metal to your hand. Thermal energy is energy that changes its form into heat. Some sources of thermal energy are Volcanoes and the Sun.
New Note
Convection is heat transferred when produced by the flow of a heated fluid (Fluids are gases and liquids). An example of convection is a hot air balloon or a convection oven.
New Note
Radiation is the transferal of radiant energy through electromagnetic waves, like light. Radiation does not need particles to transfer heat whereas, conduction and convection do. Radiation transfers heat in straight lines in every direction from the heat source. The particles hit by the electromagnetic waves absorb the radiant energy and turn it into thermal energy. The particles of colours absorb radiant energy more or less based on how dark the colour is.
