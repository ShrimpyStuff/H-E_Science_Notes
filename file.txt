Heat causes matter in any state to expand, but it can grow more or less based on the state it's within. Also, when substances enlarge, the actual size of the atoms doesn't change.
New Note
Conduction is the transfer of thermal energy through particles colliding/transfer of heat through touching. An example of conduction is touching a hot metal pan because the pan will transfer the heat from the metal to your hand. Thermal energy is energy that changes form into heat. Some sources of heat energy are volcanoes and the Sun.
New Note
Convection is how heat is transferred, caused by the flow of a heated fluid (Fluids are gases and liquids). An example of convection is a hot air balloon or a convection oven.
New Note
Radiation is the transfer of heat.
